# Fun Functions Practical

## Let's practice communicating about functions

---

# Write a function named `print_greeting` that takes a name (e.g. "Maria") and prints a greeting that includes the name (e.g. "Howdy, Maria!"). Call this function with one of your names as the argument.

---

# Write a function named `calculate_ellipse_area` that calculates the area of an ellipse based on the values of its ***a*** and ***b*** axes. The formula for the area of an ellipse is ***A = Ï€ a b***. Call this function to calculate the area of an ellipse with an ***a*** axis of 4 and a ***b*** axis of 3 and store the result in a variable named `ellipse_area`. Then, print the value of `ellipse_area`. 

---

# Write a function called `concatenate` that takes two strings and returns the two strings combined into one string. Then, write a print statement that includes a call to this function with the arguments "peri" and "winkle" to print "My favorite color is periwinkle.".

---

# Write a function named `icebreaker` that prompts the user for their name, the number of their birthday month, and the number of their birthday day and then prints a sentence that states the name and the sum of these numbers (e.g. "Maria's birthday number is 29."). Then, call this function.

---

## Write a function named `hyphenate` that takes two strings and returns them combined with a hyphen in-between them. Then, write a function named `combine_and_print_strings` that takes two strings and the function---either `concatenate` or `hyphenate`---that should be used to combine the strings. This function should print both strings and their combined form. Call the `combine_and_print_strings` function twice---once for the words "peri" and "winkle" with the `concatenate` function (which should print "Together, peri and winkle make periwinkle!") and once for the words "in" and "between" with the `hyphenate` function (which should print "Together, in and between make in-between!").
